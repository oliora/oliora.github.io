Hi! My name is **Andrey Upadyshev**. You may also know me as **Oliora**.

I'm a professional software developer for almost 20 years, passionated about C++, software architecture and high performance.
I worked at many companies in different domains with having C++ as my main programming language for most of the time. I'm in love and hate relation with C++ and esspecially interested in simulataneous rise and fade of the language.

This blog was created to share some of my findings, thoughts and ranting about C++ and, sometimes, the other tech.

# Bio

I was born in Saint-Petersburg, Russia in 1981.

In 2002 I got Bachelor degree in Computer Science at *Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics*.

In 2014 I've moved to the Netherlands.

I'm a big fan of Open Source Software and involved in several projects, most notably the following:

- [Ppconsul](https://github.com/oliora/ppconsul) - a C++ client for [Consul](https://consul.io/). I'm the author and the maintainer for this project.
- [AZMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/azmq) - the library which integrates [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) and [Boost.Asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html). I've ported it to Windows and maintaned it (along others) for some time.

Apart from software development I like to cook, travel, make photos, explore arts and enjoy good wines.
