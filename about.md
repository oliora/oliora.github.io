Hi! My name is **Andrey Upadyshev**. You may also know me as **Oliora**.

I'm a professional software developer for almost 15 years,
passionated about C++, software architecture and high performance.
Since 2016 I work for Amazon Web Services.

I'm notedly interested about continued revolution of the C++ language which already stated in C++11 and C++14 standards and now developing C++17 one.
The language was given a second breath. It was so significatly changed that it is almost a new language which we have to learn from scratch.
That's interesting and cool! Interesting because heh... who doesn't like to learn a new tricks?
And cool because we feel that some shackles on our legs fell and we have more fun and freedom with C++ now!

This blog was created to share some of my findings and thoughts (and excitements) about the new C++.

You may also like to check my [slides about C++11/C++14](http://www.slideshare.net/oliora) that I made for [Dutch C++ group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Dutch-Cpp-Group/).

# Bio

I'm a software developer and software architect for almost 15 years.
I was working in many companies in very different domains with using of tons of technologies and tools.
C++, software architecture and high performance are my main interest in the professional life.
Besides C++ I use Python and JavaScript quite often.

I'm a big fan of Open Source Software.
Currently I maintain:

- [AZMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/azmq) - the library which integrates [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) and [Boost.Asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html)
- [Ppconsul](https://github.com/oliora/ppconsul) - a C++ client for [Consul](https://consul.io/)

I was born in Saint-Petersburg, Russia in 1981.

In 2002 I got Bachelor degree in Computer Science at *Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics*.

In 2014 I've moved to the Netherlands.

Apart from developing I like to cook, travel, photograph, explore arts and enjoy good wine.
